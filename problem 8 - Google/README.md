Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today. </br>

This problem was asked by Google.<br>

A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value. </br>

Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.</br>

For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:<br>

tree = Node(0, Node(1), Node(0, Node(1, Node(1), Node(1)) , Node(0))) <br>
