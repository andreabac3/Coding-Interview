Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.<br>

This problem was asked by Cisco.<br>

Given an unsigned 8-bit integer, swap its even and odd bits. The 1st and 2nd bit should be swapped, the 3rd and 4th bit should be swapped, and so on.<br>

For example, 10101010 should be 01010101. 11100010 should be 11010001.<br>

Bonus: Can you do this in one line?<br>
