Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.<br>

This problem was asked by Twitter.<br>

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:<br>

record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log<br>
get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.<br>
You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.<br>
