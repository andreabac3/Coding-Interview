Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.<br>

This problem was asked by Pinterest.<br>

Given an integer list where each number represents the number of hops you can make, determine whether you can reach to the last index starting at index 0.<br>

For example, [2, 0, 1, 0] returns True while [1, 1, 0, 1] returns False.<br>
